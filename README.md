# Port-Bot

This is an abandoned prototype I kept developing after winning a contest on a workgroup*. It could build a good source of data for a supervised training of a convolutional neural network in order to classify pictures depending on the current labels. It was tested on OS X 10.10.5. 

Run it from its folder by typing "python3.7 start.py" and scan the QR code with a phone. Message him from other phones to initialize it. I added a queue in order to handle multiple users.

The frontend is at 127.0.0.1:8000/items/ and 127.0.0.1:8000/invalid_items/

Requirements:
 - Python 3.7
 - Golang 1.12** (OS X 10.10.5)
 - Firefox
 - Geckodriver
 - Drive***
 - Curl
 
Libraries:
 - FastAPI
 - pydantic
 - uvicorn
 - sqlalchemy
 - selenium
 - requests
 - jinja2
 - starlette


Classes of Whatsapp Web change with time, so the code has to be updated with the proper new classes. More info in the CSS SELECTORS section of port-bot.py
